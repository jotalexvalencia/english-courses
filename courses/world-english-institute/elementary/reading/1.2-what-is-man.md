## **I. Reading 1.2: What is Man?** `Ai. Ri-ding wan.tu: Wat is Man?`

**When God finished creating the animals,** `Wen God fi-nisht cri-ei-ting de a-ni-mals,` **he said,** `hi sed,` **"Now, we will make man.** `"Nau, wi wil meik man.` **We will make man a copy of ourselves.** `Wi wil meik man a co-pi ov aur-selvs.` **Man will be like us."** `Man wil bi laik as."` **So God made a man.** `So God meid a man.` **The man was a spiritual being like God.** `De man was a spi-ri-chu-al bi-ing laik God.` **But unlike God,** `Bat an-laik God,` **the man had a physical body.** `de man had a fi-si-cal bo-di.`

**God did not create the man** `God did not cri-eit de man` **by giving a command.** `bai gi-ving a co-mand.` **Instead, he took some dust** `Ins-ted, hi tuk sam dast` **from the ground** `from de graund` **and shaped it into a body** `and sheipt it in-tu a bo-di` **that had arms, legs,** `dat had arms, legs,` **hands, feet, and a heart.** `hands, fit, and a hart.` **This body had a head** `Dis bo-di had a hed` **with eyes, ears, a nose,** `wit ais, irs, a nos,` **a mouth, and a brain.** `a mauth, and a brein.` **Somehow, God molded red clay** `Sam-jau, God mol-ded red klei` **into a perfect human body.** `in-tu a per-fekt jiu-man bo-di.` **Then God breathed life** `Den God brithd laif` **into the man's nose,** `in-tu de mans nos,` **and he became a living being.** `and hi bi-keim a li-ving bi-ing.` **The man stood up before God,** `De man stud ap bi-for God,` **straight and tall.** `streit and tol.` **God called the man "Adam,"** `God cold de man "A-dam,"` **meaning "earth" or "red clay."** `mi-ning "erth" or "red klei."`

## **The Garden of Eden** `De Gar-den of I-den`

**Then the Lord God planted a garden** `Den de Lord God plan-ted a gar-den` **in a place called Eden.** `in a pleis cold I-den.` **The word "Eden" means "Pleasantness."** `De werd "I-den" mins "Ple-sant-nes."` **The Garden of Eden stretched** `De Gar-den of I-den stretcht` **hundreds of kilometers in every direction.** `jan-dreds of ki-lo-mi-ters in e-vri di-rek-shon.` **It had green grass,** `It had grin gras,` **colorful flowers, shade trees,** `ka-lor-ful flau-ers, sheid tris,` **and every fruit tree** `and e-vri frut tri` **that was good for food.** `dat was gud for fud.` **A river flowed through the garden** `A ri-ver floud thru de gar-den` **and watered the grass, trees, and flowers.** `and wo-terd de gras, tris, and flau-ers.`

## **Two Special Trees** `Tu Spe-shal Tris`

**In the middle of the garden,** `In de mi-del of de gar-den,` **the Lord God put two special trees.** `de Lord God put tu spe-shal tris.` **One was "the tree of life";** `Wan was "de tri of laif";` **the other was "the tree** `de a-der was "de tri` **that gives knowledge about good and evil."** `dat givs no-lech a-baut gud and i-vil."` **No one knows exactly** `No wan nous eg-zakt-li` **what these trees looked like.** `wat diz tris lukt laik.` **We only know they were very beautiful.** `Wi on-li nou dei wer ve-ri biu-ti-ful.` **The Garden of Eden was like** `De Gar-den of I-den was laik` **heaven on earth.** `je-ven on erth.` **Some people have called it "Paradise."** `Sam pi-pol jav cold it "Pa-ra-dais."` **Surely, it was the kind of place** `Shur-li, it was de kaind of pleis` **where any man could be happy.** `wer e-ni man cud bi ja-pi.`

**The Lord God gave Adam a job.** `De Lord God geiv A-dam a yob.` **God put the man** `God put de man` **in the garden of Eden** `in de gar-den of I-den` **to work the soil,** `tu werk de soil,` **to take care of the garden,** `tu teik ker of de gar-den,` **and to gather its fruits.** `and tu ga-der its fruts.`

## **A Command and a Warning** `A Ko-mand and a Wor-ning`

**God said to Adam,** `God sed tu A-dam,` **"You may eat from any tree** `"Yu mei it from e-ni tri` **in the garden,** `in de gar-den,` **but you must not eat** `bat yu mast not it` **from the tree that gives knowledge** `from de tri dat givs no-lech` **about good and evil.** `a-baut gud and i-vil.` **If you eat fruit from that tree,** `If yu it frut from dat tri,` **you will die."** `yu wil dai."`

## **Adam Names the Animals** `A-dam Neims de A-ni-mals`

**Then, the Lord God gave Adam** `Den, de Lord God geiv A-dam` **another job.** `a-na-der yob.` **God brought every animal of the field** `God brot e-vri a-ni-mal of de fild` **and every bird of the air** `and e-vri berd of de er` **to Adam and told Adam** `tu A-dam and told A-dam` **to give each one a name.** `tu giv ich wan a neim.` **Adam was not afraid of the animals,** `A-dam was not a-freid of de a-ni-mals,` **and they were not afraid of him.** `and dei wer not a-freid of jim.` **Adam must have studied** `A-dam mast jav sta-did` **the birds and animals carefully.** `de berds and a-ni-mals ker-fu-li.` **One by one, they came to him.** `Wan bai wan, dei keim tu jim.` **Adam gave names to all the tame animals,** `A-dam geiv neims tu ol de teim a-ni-mals,` **to all the birds of the air,** `tu ol de berds of de er,` **and to all the wild animals** `and tu ol de waild a-ni-mals` **in the forest.** `in de fo-rest.`

## **Adam is Lonely** `A-dam is Lon-li`

**Even though Adam was surrounded** `I-ven dou A-dam was sa-raun-ded` **by animals and other beautiful things** `bai a-ni-mals and a-der biu-ti-ful things` **in the garden, he was lonely.** `in de gar-den, hi was lon-li.` **No animal in the garden** `No a-ni-mal in de gar-den` **could talk to him.** `cud tok tu jim.` **Adam noticed that all the birds** `A-dam no-tist dat ol de berds` **and animals had mates.** `and a-ni-mals had meits.` **There were male ducks and female ducks,** `Der wer meil daks and fi-meil daks,` **and there were male and female elephants.** `and der wer meil and fi-meil e-le-fants.` **Every animal had its mate,** `E-vri a-ni-mal jad its meit,` **but Adam had no one** `bat A-dam jad no wan` **to be his companion.** `tu bi jis kom-pa-nion.` **He was all alone.** `Ji was ol a-lon.` **He could not find a helper** `Ji cud not faind a jel-per` **that was right for him.** `dat was rait for jim.`

## **The First Woman** `De Ferst Wu-man`

**The Lord God said,** `De Lord God sed,` **"I see that it is not good** `"Ai si dat it is not gud` **for the man to be alone.** `for de man tu bi a-lon.` **I will make a person like him** `Ai wil meik a per-son laik jim` **to help him."** `tu jelp jim."`

**So, the Lord God put Adam to sleep** `So, de Lord God put A-dam tu slip` **and took a rib from his body.** `and tuk a rib from jis bo-di.` **Then, he used the rib from the man** `Den, ji iuzd de rib from de man` **to make a woman.** `tu meik a wu-man.` **After Adam awoke,** `Af-ter A-dam a-wok,` **the Lord God brought the woman to him** `de Lord God brot de wu-man tu jim` **to be his wife.** `tu bi jis waif.`

**When Adam opened his eyes** `Wen A-dam o-pend jis ais` **and looked at the woman** `and lukt at de wu-man` **that God had brought to him,** `dat God jad brot tu jim,` **he said, "Finally!** `ji sed, "Fai-na-li!` **A person like me.** `A per-son laik mi.` **Her bones are my bones.** `Jer bons ar mai bons.` **Her body is from my body.** `Jer bo-di is from mai bo-di.` **She was taken out of man,** `Shi was tei-ken aut of man,` **so I will name her Woman."** `so ai wil neim jer Wu-man."` **The woman was called "Eve,"** `De wu-man was cold "Iv,"` **meaning "life."** `mi-ning "laif."` **Eve became the mother** `Iv bi-keim de ma-der` **of every human being on earth** `of e-vri jiu-man bi-ing on erth` **who lived after her.** `ju livd af-ter jer.`

## **The Two Become One** `De Tu Bi-kam Wan`

**Thus, God made Adam and Eve** `Das, God meid A-dam and Iv` **in his own likeness.** `in jis oun laik-nes.` **God made them as a copy of himself.** `God meid dem as a co-pi of jim-self.` **God made them male and female** `God meid dem meil and fi-meil` **and gave them a blessing.** `and geiv dem a ble-sing.` **God said to them,** `God sed tu dem,` **"Have many children.** `"Jav me-ni chil-dren.` **Fill the earth and control it."** `Fil de erth and con-trol it."`

**That is why a man leaves** `Dat is wai a man livs` **his father and mother** `jis fa-der and ma-der` **and is joined to his wife.** `and is yoind tu jis waif.` **In this way, two people become one.** `In dis wei, tu pi-pol bi-kam wan.` **The man and his wife were naked,** `De man and jis waif wer nei-ked,` **but they were not ashamed.** `bat dei wer not a-sheimd.`
