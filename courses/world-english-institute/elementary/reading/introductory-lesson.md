## **Welcome to World English Institute**

`WEL-KAM TU WERLD ING-GLISH INS-TI-TIUT`

**WEI is a correspondence school that teaches English via the Internet. WEI teachers are native English-speaking Christian men and women who primarily live in the United States. WEI teachers volunteer their time to teach you because they believe that the God who created all human beings credits their service to you as service to Him.**

`WEI is a ko-res-pon-dens skul` `dat ti-ches Ing-glish vai-a de In-ter-net.` `WEI ti-chers ar nei-tiv Ing-glish-spi-king` `Kris-chan men and wi-men` `hu prai-me-ri-li liv in de Iu-nai-ted Steits.` `WEI ti-chers vo-lon-tir der taim` `tu tich iu bi-koz dei bi-liv` `dat de God hu kri-ei-ted ol hiu-man bi-ings` `kre-dits der ser-vis tu iu` `as ser-vis tu Him.`

**The WEI course is conducted in English. It is written for students who have studied English for at least three years. The vocabulary and grammar studies range from late Elementary to early Intermediate levels. Beginners may find the course difficult. Advanced students will find it easy. More advanced courses are available when you complete the Intermediate course.**

**Please read this Introductory lesson carefully and, when you are ready, take the Introductory test. Your answers will be recorded in your private "Dashboard" on this website after you press the submit button. One of WEI's teachers will grade your exam and return it with comments to your private "Dashboard." It may take up to one week before you have a teacher, and this exam is graded. Subsequent lessons will take less time to grade because your teacher will assist you through the entire course. This website is encrypted and password-protected, so only you, your teacher, and site administrators can access your assignments, grades, and messages.**

## **The Introductory Grammar Lesson**

`DE IN-TRO-DAK-TO-RI GRA-MAR LE-SON`

**In order to understand American English, a person must learn why Americans think as they do. From the beginning, American culture has been influenced by the Bible. Coins are stamped with the sentence, "In God we trust." The pledge of allegiance includes the phrase, "one nation under God." To understand American culture, a person must know something about the Bible, the Word of God. Therefore, WEI has used stories from the Easy-to-Read Version of the Bible to illustrate points of English grammar.**

`In or-der tu an-der-stand A-me-ri-kan Ing-glish,` `a per-son mast lern wai A-me-ri-kans` `think as dei du.` `From de bi-gi-ning, A-me-ri-kan kal-cher` `has bin in-flu-enst bai de Bai-bol.` `Koins ar stampt wit de sen-tens,` `"In God wi trast."` `De plej ov a-li-jans in-kluds de freiz,` `"wan nei-shon an-der God."` `Tu an-der-stand A-me-ri-kan kal-cher,` `a per-son mast no sam-thing` `a-baut de Bai-bol, de Werd ov God.` `Der-for, WEI has iuzd sto-ris` `from de I-zi-tu-Rid Ver-shon ov de Bai-bol` `tu i-las-treit points ov Ing-glish gra-mar.`

**English grammar is the correct use of English words in sentences. It is the art of using the English language to express thoughts clearly and effectively. By studying grammar, we learn to connect words so that other people can understand what we say.**

`Ing-glish gra-mar is de ko-rekt ius` `ov Ing-glish werds in sen-ten-ses.` `It is de art ov iu-sing` `de Ing-glish lan-gwij tu eks-pres thots` `klir-li and e-fek-tiv-li.` `Bai sta-di-ing gra-mar, wi lern` `tu ko-nekt werds so dat a-der pi-pol` `kan an-der-stand wat wi sei.`

**English grammar has two main divisions: (1) The Parts of Speech, and (2) The Sentence.**

`Ing-glish gra-mar has tu mein di-vi-shons:` `(wan) De Parts ov Spich, and` `(tu) De Sen-tens.`

## **The Parts of Speech**

`DE PARTS OV SPICH`

**All words in the English language may be divided into eight main groups or "parts of speech": nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections.**

`Ol werds in de Ing-glish lan-gwij` `mei bi di-vai-ded in-tu eit mein grups` `or "parts ov spich": nauns, pro-nauns,` `ad-jek-tivs, verbs, ad-verbs, pre-po-si-shons,` `kon-jank-shons, and in-ter-jek-shons.`

**1. A noun is a word that names a person, place, thing, condition, feeling or event. There are (a) common nouns and (b) proper nouns.**
**a. A common noun names any of a class of persons, places, things, conditions, feelings, or events. Examples: boy, girl, city, state, country, mountain, river, love, joy, peace. A common noun never begins with a capital letter except at the beginning of a sentence or when used with a proper noun. Examples: Snake River, Lincoln Middle School.**
**b. A proper noun is the official name of a person, place, or thing. Examples: David, Mary, Dallas, Texas, Egypt, Everest, and Amazon. A proper noun always begins with a capital letter.**

`wan. A naun is a werd dat neims` `a per-son, pleis, thing, kon-di-shon,` `fi-ling or i-vent. Der ar` `(ei) ko-mon nauns and` `(bi) pro-per nauns.`
`ei. A ko-mon naun neims e-ni` `ov a klas ov per-sons, plei-ses,` `things, kon-di-shons, fi-lings, or i-vents.` `Eg-zam-pols: boi, gerl, si-ti, steit,` `kan-tri, maun-tin, ri-ver, lov, joi, pis.` `A ko-mon naun ne-ver bi-gins` `wit a ka-pi-tal le-ter ek-sept` `at de bi-gi-ning ov a sen-tens` `or wen iuzd wit a pro-per naun.` `Eg-zam-pols: Sneik Ri-ver, Lin-koln Mi-dol Skul.`
`bi. A pro-per naun is de o-fi-shal neim` `ov a per-son, pleis, or thing.` `Eg-zam-pols: Dei-vid, Me-ri, Da-las,` `Tek-sas, I-jipt, E-ve-rest, and A-ma-zon.` `A pro-per naun ol-weis bi-gins` `wit a ka-pi-tal le-ter.`

**2. A pronoun is a word that takes the place of a noun. Examples: I, you, he, she, it, we, they, them, this, that, these, those, who, which, what. Sentence: "I love you." The pronoun "I" is always capitalized.**

`tu. A pro-naun is a werd` `dat teiks de pleis ov a naun.` `Eg-zam-pols: Ai, iu, hi, shi, it,` `wi, dei, dem, dis, dat, diz,` `doz, hu, wich, wat. Sen-tens:` `"Ai lov iu." De pro-naun "Ai"` `is ol-weis ka-pi-ta-laizd.`

**3. An adjective is a word that describes or limits a noun or a pronoun. Examples: a, an, the, one, my, our, your, her, his, its, their, red, big, good, evil, tall, short. Sentence: "Your mother is a good woman."**

`thri. An ad-jek-tiv is a werd` `dat di-skraibs or li-mits` `a naun or a pro-naun.` `Eg-zam-pols: a, an, de, wan,` `mai, aur, yor, her, his, its,` `der, red, big, gud, i-vil, tol, short.` `Sen-tens: "Yor ma-der is a gud wu-man."`

**4. A verb is a word that expresses an action or state of being. Examples of action verbs are run, walk, fly, teach, learn, eat, sleep, and work. "They walk to school." State of being verbs: be, is, am, are, feel, appear, sound, seem. Sentence: "They are tall."**

`for. A verb is a werd dat eks-pre-ses` `an ak-shon or steit ov bi-ing.` `Eg-zam-pols ov ak-shon verbs ar` `ran, wok, flai, tich, lern,` `it, slip, and werk. "Dei wok tu skul."` `Steit ov bi-ing verbs: bi, is,` `am, ar, fil, a-pir, saund, sim.` `Sen-tens: "Dei ar tol."`

**5. An adverb is a word that describes or limits a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. Examples: then, today, now, tomorrow, soon, here, there, everywhere, quickly, beautifully, carefully, well, barely, nearly, completely. Sentence: "They walk quickly."**

`faiv. An ad-verb is a werd` `dat di-skraibs or li-mits a verb,` `an ad-jek-tiv, or a-na-der ad-verb.` `Eg-zam-pols: den, tu-dei, nau, tu-mo-ro,` `sun, hir, der, ev-ri-wer, kwik-li,` `biu-ti-fu-li, ker-ful-li, wel, ber-li,` `nir-li, kom-plit-li. Sen-tens: "Dei wok kwik-li."`

**6. A preposition is a word that shows the relationship between a word that comes before it and a noun or pronoun that follows it. Examples: in, at, by, near, to, from, into, before, after, during, until, like. Sentence: "John ran to school."**

`siks. A pre-po-si-shon is a werd` `dat shos de ri-lei-shon-ship` `bi-twin a werd dat kams bi-for it` `and a naun or pro-naun dat fo-los it.` `Eg-zam-pols: in, at, bai, nir,` `tu, from, in-tu, bi-for, af-ter,` `diu-ring, an-til, laik. Sen-tens:` `"Jon ran tu skul."`

**7. A conjunction is a word that connects words, phrases, or clauses to one another. Examples: and, but, yet. Sentence: "The son was hungry and needed money." The conjunction "and" links the first part of the sentence with the second part.**

`se-ven. A kon-jank-shon is a werd` `dat ko-nekts werds, frei-zes,` `or klo-zes tu wan a-na-der.` `Eg-zam-pols: and, bat, yet. Sen-tens:` `"De san was han-gri and ni-ded ma-ni."` `De kon-jank-shon "and" links` `de ferst part ov de sen-tens` `wit de se-kond part.`

**8. An interjection is a word or group of words used to express sudden and strong feelings. Examples: Ah! Oh! Wow! Oh no! Sentence: "Oh! How I want to go home!" By learning the eight parts of speech and their meanings, you have taken a big step toward mastering the English language.**

`eit. An in-ter-jek-shon is a werd` `or grup ov werds iuzd` `tu eks-pres sa-den and strong fi-lings.` `Eg-zam-pols: A! O! Wau! O no!` `Sen-tens: "O! Hau Ai want tu go hom!"` `Bai ler-ning de eit parts ov spich` `and der mi-nings, iu hav tei-ken` `a big step to-word mas-te-ring` `de Ing-glish lan-gwij.`

## **The Sentence**

`DE SEN-TENS`

**Now let us look briefly at the second major division of English grammar, The Sentence. A sentence is a group of words joined together to express a complete thought. Every sentence is made up of two main parts: (1) the subject, and (2) the predicate.**

`Nau let as luk brif-li at de se-kond` `mei-jor di-vi-shon ov Ing-glish gra-mar,` `De Sen-tens. A sen-tens is a grup` `ov werds joind tu-ge-der` `tu eks-pres a kom-plit thot.` `Ev-ri sen-tens is meid ap` `ov tu mein parts: (wan) de sab-jekt,` `and (tu) de pre-di-keit.`

**1. The subject is the part of the sentence that tells who or what the sentence is about. For example, "God is love." In this sentence, "God" is the subject. He is the person being discussed.**

`wan. De sab-jekt is de part` `ov de sen-tens dat tels hu` `or wat de sen-tens is a-baut.` `For eg-zam-pol, "God is lov."` `In dis sen-tens, "God" is de sab-jekt.` `Hi is de per-son bi-ing dis-kast.`

**2. The predicate is the part of the sentence that tells what the subject is or does. The predicate always includes a verb. In the sentence above, "is love" is the predicate. That is what is said about God.**

`tu. De pre-di-keit is de part` `ov de sen-tens dat tels` `wat de sab-jekt is or daz.` `De pre-di-keit ol-weis in-kluds a verb.` `In de sen-tens a-bav, "is lov"` `is de pre-di-keit. Dat is` `wat is sed a-baut God.`

## **Types of Sentences**

`TAIPS OV SEN-TEN-SES`

**Sentences are divided into four classes according to the way they express a thought: (1) declarative, (2) interrogative, (3) imperative, and (4) exclamatory.**

`Sen-ten-ses ar di-vai-ded in-tu for kla-ses` `a-kor-ding tu de wei dei eks-pres a thot:` `(wan) de-kla-ra-tiv, (tu) in-te-ro-ga-tiv,` `(thri) im-pe-ra-tiv, and (for) eks-kla-ma-to-ri.`

**A declarative sentence makes a statement about something and ends with a period (.). Example: "A man had two sons."**

`A de-kla-ra-tiv sen-tens meiks a steit-ment` `a-baut sam-thing and ends wit a pi-ri-od (.).` `Eg-zam-pol: "A man had tu sans."`

**An interrogative sentence asks a question and ends with a question mark (?). Example: "What does all this mean?"**

`An in-te-ro-ga-tiv sen-tens asks a kwes-chon` `and ends wit a kwes-chon mark (?).` `Eg-zam-pol: "Wat daz ol dis min?"`

**An imperative sentence makes a request or gives a command and ends with a period or an exclamation point (!). Examples: "Hurry!" "Bring our best calf and kill it so that we can celebrate." In imperative sentences, "you" is understood: (You) bring our best calf."**

`An im-pe-ra-tiv sen-tens meiks a ri-kwest` `or givs a ko-mand and ends` `wit a pi-ri-od or an eks-kla-mei-shon point (!).` `Eg-zam-pols: "Ha-ri!" "Bring aur best kaf` `and kil it so dat wi kan se-le-breit."` `In im-pe-ra-tiv sen-ten-ses, "iu" is an-der-stud:` `(Iu) bring aur best kaf."`

**An exclamatory sentence says something with force and emotion and ends with an exclamation point (!). Example: "My son was dead, but now he is alive again!"**

`An eks-kla-ma-to-ri sen-tens sez sam-thing` `wit fors and i-mo-shon and ends` `wit an eks-kla-mei-shon point (!).` `Eg-zam-pol: "Mai san was ded,` `bat nau hi is a-laiv a-gen!"`

## **Your Assignment**

`IOR A-SAIN-MENT`

**Now, read the story of the son who left home. This is the world's most famous short story. It is found in the fifteenth chapter of the gospel of Luke, verses eleven through thirty-two (Luke 15:11-32). It is quoted from the Easy-to-Read Version of the Bible. After you read the story, please answer the questions on the Answer Sheet.**

`Nau, rid de sto-ri ov de san` `hu left hom. Dis is de werlds` `most fei-mos short sto-ri.` `It is faund in de fif-tinth chap-ter` `ov de gos-pel ov Luk, ver-ses i-le-ven` `thru ther-ti-tu (Luk 15:11-32).` `It is kwo-ted from de I-zi-tu-Rid` `Ver-shon ov de Bai-bol.` `Af-ter iu rid de sto-ri,` `pliz an-ser de kwes-chons` `on de An-ser Shit.`


## **Story of the Son Who Left Home**

`STO-RI OV DE SAN HU LEFT HOM`

**A man had two sons. The younger son said to his father, "Give me my part of all the things we own." So, the father divided his wealth with his two sons.**

`A man had tu sans.` `De yang-er san sed tu his fa-der,` `"Giv mi mai part ov ol` `de things wi on." So, de fa-der` `di-vai-ded his welth wit his tu sans.`

**The younger son gathered up all that he had and left. He traveled far away to another country. There, he foolishly wasted his money. He spent everything that he had. Soon after that, the land became very dry, and there was no rain. There was not enough food to eat anywhere in the country. The son was hungry and needed money. So he went and got a job with one of the people of that country. The man sent the son into the field to feed pigs. The son was so hungry that he wanted to eat the food that the pigs were eating. But no person gave him anything.**

`De yang-er san ga-derd ap` `ol dat hi had and left.` `Hi tra-veld far a-wei` `tu a-na-der kan-tri. Der,` `hi fu-lish-li weis-ted his ma-ni.` `Hi spent ev-ri-thing dat hi had.` `Sun af-ter dat, de land bi-keim` `ve-ri drai, and der was no rein.` `Der was not i-naf fud tu it` `e-ni-wer in de kan-tri.` `De san was han-gri and ni-ded ma-ni.` `So hi went and got a job` `wit wan ov de pi-pol ov dat kan-tri.` `De man sent de san in-tu de fild` `tu fid pigs` **(alimentar cerdos)**`. De san was so han-gri` `dat hi wan-ted tu it de fud` `dat de pigs wer i-ting.` `Bat no per-son geiv him e-ni-thing.`

**The boy realized that he had been very foolish. He thought, "All of my father's servants have plenty of food. But I am here, almost dead, because I have nothing to eat. I will leave and go to my father. I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against God and have done wrong to you. I am not good enough to be called your son. But let me be like one of your servants."**

`De boi ri-a-laizd dat hi had bin` `ve-ri fu-lish. Hi thot, "Ol ov mai fa-ders` `ser-vants hav plen-ti ov fud.` `Bat Ai am hir, ol-most ded,` `bi-koz Ai hav na-thing tu it.` `Ai wil liv and go tu mai fa-der.` `Ai wil sei tu him, "Fa-der,` `Ai hav sind a-genst God` `and hav dan rong tu iu.` `Ai am not gud i-naf` `tu bi kold yor san.` `Bat let mi bi laik wan` `ov yor ser-vants."`

**While the son was still a long way off, his father saw him coming. The father felt sorry for his son. So the father ran to him. He hugged and kissed his son. The son said, 'Father, I have sinned against God and have done wrong to you. I am not good enough to be called your son."**

`Wail de san was stil a long wei of,` `his fa-der so him ka-ming.` `De fa-der felt so-ri for his san.` `So de fa-der ran tu him.` `Hi hagd and kist his san.` `De san sed, 'Fa-der,` `Ai hav sind a-genst God` `and hav dan rong tu iu.` `Ai am not gud i-naf` `tu bi kold yor san."`

**"But the father said to his servants, 'Hurry! Bring the best clothes and dress him. Also, put a ring on his finger and good shoes on his feet. Bring the fat calf. We will kill it and have plenty to eat. Then, we can have a party. My son was dead, but now he is alive again! He was lost, but now he is found!" So they began to have a party.**

`"Bat de fa-der sed tu his ser-vants,` `'Ha-ri! Bring de best kloths` `and dres him. Ol-so, put a ring` `on his fing-er and gud shus` `on his fit. Bring de fat kaf` **(ternero gordo)**`. Wi wil kil it and hav plen-ti tu it.` `Den, wi kan hav a par-ti.` `Mai san was ded, bat nau` `hi is a-laiv a-gen! Hi was lost,` `bat nau hi is faund!"` `So dei bi-gan tu hav a par-ti.`

**The older son was in the field. He came closer to the house. He heard the sound of music and dancing. So the older son called to one of the servant boys and asked, 'What does all this mean?' The servant said, "Your brother has come back. Your father killed the fat calf to eat. Your father is happy because your brother came home safely."**

`De ol-der san was in de fild.` `Hi keim klo-ser tu de haus.` `Hi herd de saund ov miu-zik and dan-sing.` `So de ol-der san kold tu wan` `ov de ser-vant bois and askt,` `'Wat daz ol dis min?'` `De ser-vant sed, "Yor bra-der has kam bak.` `Yor fa-der kild de fat kaf tu it.` `Yor fa-der is ha-pi bi-koz` `yor bra-der keim hom seif-li."`

**The older son was angry and would not enter the party. So his father went out to ask him to come in. The son said to his father, "I have served you like a slave for many years. I have always obeyed your commands. But you never even killed a goat for me. You never gave a party for me and my friends. But your other son has wasted all your money on prostitutes. Then, he comes home, and you kill the fat calf for him!"**

`De ol-der san was ang-gri` `and wud not en-ter de par-ti.` `So his fa-der went aut` `tu ask him tu kam in.` `De san sed tu his fa-der,` `"Ai hav servd iu laik a sleiv` `for me-ni yirs. Ai hav ol-weis` `o-beid yor ko-mands. Bat iu` `ne-ver i-ven kild a got for mi.` `Iu ne-ver geiv a par-ti` `for mi and mai frends.` `Bat yor a-der san has weis-ted` `ol yor ma-ni on pros-ti-tiuts` **(prostitutas)**`. Den, hi kams hom,` `and iu kil de fat kaf for him!"`

**But the father said to him, "Son, you are always with me. All that I have is yours, too. We must be happy and have a party because your brother was dead, and now he is alive. He was lost, but now he is found."'**

`Bat de fa-der sed tu him,` `"San, iu ar ol-weis wit mi.` `Ol dat Ai hav is iors, tu.` `Wi mast bi ha-pi and hav a par-ti` `bi-koz yor bra-der was ded,` `and nau hi is a-laiv.` `Hi was lost, bat nau hi is faund."'`

## **Application**

`A-PLI-KEI-SHON` **(Aplicación)**

**This famous story teaches us some important lessons about God and about ourselves.**

`Dis fei-mos sto-ri ti-ches as` `sam im-por-tant le-sons a-baut God` `and a-baut aur-selvs.`

**1. People seek happiness in the wrong places. The younger son thought happiness was getting away from his father's control and being free to have fun. In the end, he was miserable because he was looking for happiness in the wrong places. People in today's world are making the same mistake. They are seeking happiness in money, drugs, alcohol, sex, thrills, education, power, fame, and beauty. But selfish living does not lead to joy. It leads to suffering and shame.**

`wan. Pi-pol sik ha-pi-nes` `in de rong plei-ses. De yang-er san` `thot ha-pi-nes was ge-ting a-wei` `from his fa-ders kon-trol` `and bi-ing fri tu hav fan.` `In de end, hi was mi-se-ra-bol` `bi-koz hi was lu-king for ha-pi-nes` `in de rong plei-ses. Pi-pol` `in tu-deis werld ar mei-king` `de seim mis-teik. Dei ar si-king` `ha-pi-nes in ma-ni, drags, al-ko-hol,` `seks, thrils, e-diu-kei-shon, pau-er, feim, and biu-ti.` `Bat sel-fish li-ving daz not lid` `tu joi. It lids tu sa-fe-ring and sheim.`

**2. God loves us and does not want us to be ruined by evil. The younger son represents any person who turns away from God to seek fame, fortune, and pleasure. The father in the story represents God. When the younger son returned home, the father ran to meet him, hugged him, and kissed him tenderly. That means that God loves us. When we turn away from evil and come to God, he forgives us, welcomes us, and restores our dignity and honor.**

God lavs as and daz not` `want as tu bi ru-ind bai i-vil.` `De yang-er san re-pre-sents e-ni per-son` `hu terns a-wei from God` `tu sik feim, for-chun, and ple-sher.` `De fa-der in de sto-ri` `re-pre-sents God.
