**Welcome to the Easy-to-Read Bible Course. You are about to begin a journey through the Bible that could be the most important journey you ever make.**

**In Lessons labeled 1. (then the lesson number), in the section entitled The Conflict Between Good and Evil, our trip through the Bible begins with the creation of the universe. First, we are introduced to God, the powerful, intelligent, and loving Creator. We get acquainted with the first man and woman and discover what and who we were meant to be. Then, we come face-to-face with the problem of evil and see how sin spoiled everything. Finally, we learn how God responded to evil long ago and developed a plan for mending our broken relationship with him.**

**In Lessons labeled 2. (then the lesson number), in the section entitled The King Is Coming, you will watch the plan of God unfold through the families of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. You will thrill to the story of the Exodus as God leads the Israelites out of Egypt, the land where they lived as slaves for hundreds of years. You will learn about the important agreement that God made with Moses and the Israelite nation. Finally, you will sense excitement when God promises to send Someone to defeat the forces of evil and to rule over the kingdom of God forever.**

**The Conflict Between Good & Evil**

`DE CON-FLIKT BI-TUIN GUD & I-VOL`
`De Con-flikt bi-tuin Gud and I-vol` **(El Conflicto entre el Bien y el Mal)**

**God Creates the Universe**

`GOD CRI-EITS DE IU-NI-VERS`
`God Cri-eits de Iu-ni-vers` **(Dios Crea el Universo)**

**This beautiful earth on which we live is very old. It is so old that nobody knows when it came into being. Long before there was an earth, however, there was the living God. He has always existed.**

`Dis biu-ti-ful erth on` `uich ui liv is` `ve-ri old. It is` `so old dat no-bo-di` `nous uen it keim` `in-tu bi-ing. Long bi-for` `der uas an erth,` `hau-e-ver, der uas de` `li-ving God. Hi has` `ol-ueis eg-sis-ted.`

**At the beginning of time, the living God spoke, and the universe appeared. Think of it! God made the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, and the planets out of nothing—simply by giving a command.**

`At de bi-gi-ning ov` `taim, de li-ving God` `spouk, and de iu-ni-vers` `a-pird. Think ov it!` `God meid de erth,` `de san, de mun,` `de stars, and de` `pla-nets aut ov na-thing—sim-pli` `bai gi-ving a co-mand.`

**At first, the earth was completely empty. It had no tall mountains or rushing rivers, green valleys with red and yellow flowers, or blue skies and rainbows. It had no white clouds or deep blue seas. The earth was without form and was covered by total darkness. There was no life at all.**

`At ferst, de erth` `uas com-pli-tli em-pti. It` `had no tol maun-tins` `or ra-shing ri-vers, grin` `va-lis with red and` `ie-lo flau-ers, or blu` `skais and rein-bous. It` `had no uait klauds` `or dip blu sis.` `De erth uas ui-daut` `form and uas ca-verd` `bai tou-tal dark-nes. Der` `uas no laif at` `ol.`

**THE FIRST DAY — LIGHT**

`DE FERST DEI — LAIT`
`De Ferst Dei — Lait` **(El Primer Día — Luz)**

**Darkness covered the ocean, and God's Spirit moved over the water. Then God said, "Let there be light!" And light began to shine. He saw the light, and he knew that it was good. Then, he separated the light from the darkness. God named the light "day" and called the darkness "night."**

`Dark-nes ca-verd de ou-shan,` `and Gods Spi-rit muvd` `o-ver de uo-ter. Den` `God sed, "Let der` `bi lait!" And lait` `bi-gan tu shain. Hi` `so de lait, and` `hi niu dat it` `uas gud. Den, hi` `se-pa-rei-ted de lait from` `de dark-nes. God neimd` `de lait "dei" and` `cold de dark-nes "nait."`

**THE SECOND DAY — SKY**

`DE SE-COND DEI — SKAI`
`De Se-cond Dei — Skai` **(El Segundo Día — Cielo)**

**Then God said, "Let there be space to separate the water into two parts. So God made the space and separated the water. As God spoke, some of the mist rose into the air and became clouds. Some of it fell to the earth as water. Some of the water was above the space, and some of the water was below the space. God named that space "sky."**

`Den God sed, "Let` `der bi speis tu` `se-pa-reit de uo-ter in-tu` `tu parts. So God` `meid de speis and` `se-pa-rei-ted de uo-ter. As` `God spouk, sam ov` `de mist rous in-tu` `de air and bi-keim` `klauds. Sam ov it` `fel tu de erth` `as uo-ter. Sam ov` `de uo-ter uas a-bav` `de speis, and sam` `ov de uo-ter uas` `bi-lou de speis. God` `neimd dat speis "skai."`

**THE THIRD DAY— DRY LAND AND PLANTS**

`DE THERD DEI— DRAI LAND AND PLANTS`
`De Therd Dei— Drai Land and Plants` **(El Tercer Día — Tierra Seca y Plantas)**

**Then God said, "Let the water under the sky be gathered together so the dry land will appear." And it happened. When God spoke, mountains rose out of the water, and the water ran together and filled the deep places. God named the dry land earth. And God called the water that was gathered together seas. And God saw that this was good.**

`Den God sed, "Let` `de uo-ter an-der de` `skai bi ga-derd tu-ge-der` `so de drai land` `wil a-pir." And it` `ha-pend. Uen God spouk,` `maun-tins rous aut ov` `de uo-ter, and de` `uo-ter ran tu-ge-der and` `fild de dip plei-ses.` `God neimd de drai` `land erth. And God` `cold de uo-ter dat` `uas ga-derd tu-ge-der sis.` `And God so dat` `dis uas gud.`

**Then God said, "Let the earth grow grass, plants that make grain, and fruit trees. The fruit trees will make fruit with seeds in it. And each plant will make its own kind of seed." And it happened. Plants came up all over the earth. Fruit trees, shade trees, berry bushes, and green grass covered the ground. Every plant had its own kind of seeds to reproduce itself. The land was green with vegetation, and God saw that it was good.**

`Den God sed, "Let` `de erth grou gras,` `plants dat meik grein,` `and frut tris. De` `frut tris wil meik` `frut with sids in` `it. And ich plant` `wil meik its oun` `kaind ov sid." And` `it ha-pend. Plants keim` `ap ol o-ver de` `erth. Frut tris, sheid` `tris, be-ri bu-shes, and` `grin gras ca-verd de` `graund. E-vri plant had` `its oun kaind ov` `sids tu ri-pro-dius it-self.` `De land uas grin` `with ve-ye-tei-shon, and God` `so dat it uas` `gud.`

**THE FOURTH DAY — SUN, MOON, AND STARS**

`DE FORTH DEI — SAN, MUN, AND STARS`
`De Forth Dei — San, Mun, and Stars` **(El Cuarto Día — Sol, Luna, y Estrellas)**

**Then God said, "Let there be lights in the sky. These lights will separate the days from the nights. They will be used for signs to show when special meetings begin and to show the days and the years." And it happened.**

`Den God sed, "Let` `der bi laits in` `de skai. Dis laits` `wil se-pa-reit de deis` `from de naits. Dei` `wil bi iust for` `sains tu shou uen` `spe-shal mi-tings bi-gin and` `tu shou de deis` `and de yirs." And` `it ha-pend.`

**So God made the two large lights appear. He made the sun to rule during the day and the moon to rule during the night. God also made the stars appear. God put these lights in the sky to shine on the earth. They separated the light from the darkness, and God saw that this was good.**

`So God meid de` `tu lary laits a-pir.` `Hi meid de san` `tu rul du-ring de` `dei and de mun` `tu rul du-ring de` `nait. God ol-so meid` `de stars a-pir. God` `put dis laits in` `de skai tu shain` `on de erth. Dei` `se-pa-rei-ted de lait from` `de dark-nes, and God` `so dat dis uas` `gud.`

**THE FIFTH DAY— FISH AND BIRDS**

`DE FIFTH DEI— FISH AND BIRDS`
`De Fifth Dei— Fish and Birds` **(El Quinto Día — Peces y Pájaros)**

**On the morning of the fifth day, the sun rose in the east and warmed the green grass and bright flowers, but no fish swam in the waters. No birds sang in the trees.**

`On de mor-ning ov` `de fifth dei, de` `san rous in de` `ist and uormd de` `grin gras and brait` `flau-ers, bat no fish` `suam in de uo-ters.` `No birds sang in` `de tris.`

**Then God said, "Let the water be filled with many living things, and let there be birds to fly in the air over the earth." So God created the large sea animals such as whales. He created all the many living things in the sea, lakes, and rivers.**

`Den God sed, "Let` `de uo-ter bi fild` `with me-ni li-ving things,` `and let der bi` `birds tu flai in` `de air o-ver de` `erth." So God cri-ei-ted` `de lary si a-ni-mals` `sach as ueils. Hi` `cri-ei-ted ol de me-ni` `li-ving things in de` `si, leiks, and ri-vers.`

**He also created every kind of bird that flies in the air. He created birds that lived near the water, such as ducks and geese, and birds that lived in the wilderness, such as hawks and eagles. Birds screeched, chirped, and sang their songs. The hills and lakes were alive with living things, and God saw this was good.**

`Hi ol-so cri-ei-ted e-vri` `kaind ov bird dat` `flais in de air.` `Hi cri-ei-ted birds dat` `livd nir de uo-ter,` `sach as daks and` `guis, and birds dat` `livd in de uil-der-nes,` `sach as hoks and` `i-gols. Birds skricht, chirpt,` `and sang der songs.` `De hils and leiks` `uer a-laiv with li-ving` `things, and God so` `dis uas gud.`

**THE SIXTH DAY — LAND ANIMALS AND PEOPLE**

`DE SIKSTH DEI — LAND A-NI-MALS AND PI-POL`
`De Siksth Dei — Land A-ni-mals and Pi-pol` **(El Sexto Día — Animales Terrestres y Personas)**

**Then God said, "Let there be many different kinds of animals. Let there be large animals and small crawling animals of every kind. And let all these animals produce more animals." And all these things happened.**

`Den God sed, "Let` `der bi me-ni di-fe-rent` `kainds ov a-ni-mals. Let` `der bi lary a-ni-mals` `and smol cro-ling a-ni-mals` `ov e-vri kaind. And` `let ol dis a-ni-mals` `pro-dius mor a-ni-mals." And` `ol dis things ha-pend.`

**So God made every kind of animal. He made the wild animals such as lions, tigers, and bears to live in the forest. He also made tame animals such as horses, cows, and sheep. God made small animals that crawled on the earth and insects that flew through the air with buzzing sounds. Animals were running and crawling all over God's beautiful world, and God saw this was good.**

`So God meid e-vri` `kaind ov a-ni-mal. Hi` `meid de uaild a-ni-mals` `sach as lai-ons, tai-gers,` `and bers tu liv` `in de fo-rest. Hi` `ol-so meid teim a-ni-mals` `sach as hor-ses, caus,` `and ship. God meid` `smol a-ni-mals dat crold` `on de erth and` `in-sekts dat flu thru` `de air with ba-sing` `saunds. A-ni-mals uer ra-ning` `and cro-ling ol o-ver` `Gods biu-ti-ful uerld, and` `God so dis uas` `gud.`

**God's greatest creation has yet to come. After he had finished creating the animals, God said, "Now let's make humans who will be like us. They will rule over all the fish in the sea and the birds in the air. They will rule over all the large animals and all the little things that crawl on the earth."**

`Gods grei-test cri-ei-shon has` `yet tu cam. Af-ter` `hi had fi-nisht cri-ei-ting` `de a-ni-mals, God sed,` `"Nau lets meik hiu-mans` `ju wil bi laik` `as. Dei wil rul` `o-ver ol de fish` `in de si and` `de birds in de` `air. Dei wil rul` `o-ver ol de lary` `a-ni-mals and ol de` `li-tol things dat crol` `on de erth."`

**In Lesson 1.2, we will see that God created the first man by forming his body out of the dust of the earth and breathing into his nose the breath of life.**

`In Le-son Uan Point Tu,` `ui wil si dat` `God cri-ei-ted de ferst` `man bai for-ming his` `bo-di aut ov de` `dast ov de erth` `and bri-ding in-tu his` `nous de breth ov` `laif.`

**So, God created humans in his own likeness. He created them to be like himself. He created them male and female. God blessed them and said to them, "Have many children. Fill the earth and take control of it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds of the air. Rule over every living thing that moves on the earth."**

`So, God cri-ei-ted hiu-mans` `in his oun laik-nes.` `Hi cri-ei-ted dem tu` `bi laik him-self. Hi` `cri-ei-ted dem meil and` `fi-meil. God blest dem` `and sed tu dem,` `"Hav me-ni chil-dren. Fil` `de erth and teik` `con-trol ov it. Rul` `o-ver de fish in` `de si and de` `birds ov de air.` `Rul o-ver e-vri li-ving` `thing dat muvs on` `de erth."`

**God looked at everything he had made and saw that everything was very good.**

`God lukt at e-vri-thing` `hi had meid and` `so dat e-vri-thing uas` `ve-ri gud.`

**THE SEVENTH DAY — REST**

`DE SE-VENTH DEI — REST`
`De Se-venth Dei — Rest` **(El Séptimo Día — Descanso)**

**So the earth, the sky, and everything in them were finished. God finished the work he was doing. So, on the seventh day, he rested from his work.**

`So de erth, de` `skai, and e-vri-thing in` `dem uer fi-nisht. God` `fi-nisht de uerk hi` `uas du-ing. So, on` `de se-venth dei, hi` `res-ted from his uerk.`

**In the beginning, God created the universe. God spoke, and there was light. God spoke, and there was air, and there was water. God spoke, and there was dry land covered with plants. God spoke, and the sun, moon, and stars appeared. God spoke, and there were fish in the waters and birds in the air. God spoke, and the earth was filled with animals. Then, God carefully formed a man out of the dust of the earth. Finally, he made a woman. Then, he rested.**

`In de bi-gi-ning, God` `cri-ei-ted de iu-ni-vers. God` `spouk, and der uas` `lait. God spouk, and` `der uas air, and` `der uas uo-ter. God` `spouk, and der uas` `drai land ca-verd with` `plants. God spouk, and` `de san, mun, and` `stars a-pird. God spouk,` `and der uer fish` `in de uo-ters and` `birds in de air.` `God spouk, and de` `erth uas fild with` `a-ni-mals. Den, God ke-re-fu-li` `formd a man aut` `ov de dast ov` `de erth. Fai-na-li, hi` `meid a wu-man. Den,` `hi res-ted.`

**This is the story about the creation of the sky and the earth. When we read this Bible story, we begin to learn about the God who created everything.**

`Dis is de sto-ri` `a-baut de cri-ei-shon ov` `de skai and de` `erth. Uen ui rid` `dis Bai-bol sto-ri, ui` `bi-gin tu lern a-baut` `de God ju cri-ei-ted` `e-vri-thing.`

**WHO IS GOD?**

`JU IS GOD?`
`Ju is God?` **(¿Quién es Dios?)**

**What do we learn about God from this story? We see several important things:**

`Uat du ui lern` `a-baut God from dis` `sto-ri? Ui si se-ve-ral` `im-por-tant things:`

**1. God is eternal. He had no beginning; he has always been alive. He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. With him, there is no past and no future. God sees our past and future as clearly as he sees our present. God is eternal.**

`Wan. God is i-ter-nal.` `Hi had no bi-gi-ning;` `hi has ol-ueis bin` `a-laiv. Hi is de` `seim ies-ter-dei, tu-dei, and` `fo-re-ver. With him, der` `is no past and` `no fiu-chur. God sis` `aur past and fiu-chur` `as klir-li as hi` `sis aur pre-sent. God` `is i-ter-nal.`

**2. God is powerful. All the energy in our universe comes from God. Every star is a giant ball of fire burning itself out. Our sun is covered with fiery explosions. Some of the flames from these explosions leap upward 160,000 kilometers (100,000 miles).**

`Tu. God is pau-er-ful.` `Ol de e-ner-yi in` `aur iu-ni-vers cams from` `God. E-vri star is` `a yai-ant bol ov` `fair ber-ning it-self aut.` `Aur san is ca-verd` `with fai-e-ri eks-plo-shons. Sam` `ov de fleims from` `dis eks-plo-shons lip ap-uord` `uan-siks-ti thou-sand ki-lo-mi-ters` `(uan-han-dred thou-sand mails).`

**What is the source of such powerful energy? The energy of the universe did not generate itself. It came from an all-powerful God.**

`Uat is de sors` `ov sach pau-er-ful e-ner-yi?` `De e-ner-yi ov de` `iu-ni-vers did not ye-ne-reit` `it-self. It keim from` `an ol-pau-er-ful God.`

**3. God is intelligent. The more deeply we look into the mysteries of nature, the more evidence we find of intelligent planning. Who designed the human brain? Inner ear? The heart? Who drew the plans for the hand, the eye, the nose, the lungs, the stomach, and the reproductive system?**

`Thri. God is in-te-li-yent.` `De mor dip-li ui` `luk in-tu de mis-te-ris` `ov nei-chur, de mor` `e-vi-dens ui faind ov` `in-te-li-yent pla-ning. Ju di-saind` `de hiu-man brein? I-ner` `ir? De hart? Ju` `dru de plans for` `de hand, de ai,` `de nous, de langs,` `de sto-mak, and de` `ri-pro-dak-tiv sis-tem?`

**These things could not have happened by accident any more than this book that you are reading could accidentally fall together. Every scientific discovery gives more evidence that a superior intelligence produced the world we live in. That intelligence is God.**

`Dis things cud not` `hav ha-pend bai ak-si-dent` `e-ni mor dan dis` `buk dat iu ar` `ri-ding cud ak-si-den-ta-li fol` `tu-ge
